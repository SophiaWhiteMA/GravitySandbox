## About 

 In this physics sandbox, you're able to create orbiting bodies and watch them whirl around the vacuum of space. 

 ## Controls

The controls largely revolve around which orbiting body is the active body. The active body will pulse for visual clarity. 

### Creating a body

Clicking on empty space without an active body selected will create a new one where you clicked and set it to the active body. 

### Selecting a body

Click on an orbiting body to select it as the active body. With an active body selected and the game paused, you can edit its properties (such as mass, velocity, radius, etc.) or delete it. Clicking on empty space with a body selected will clear your selection. 

### Pause/upause

The simulation can be paused/unpaused using the settings menu.
